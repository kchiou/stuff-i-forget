Stuff I Routinely Forget How to Do
==================================

This is an idea stolen from [Christina Bergey](http://christinabergey.com). Her [original project](http://github.com/bergeycm/stuff-i-forget). And her original description:

> I need an internet connection to program well because I'm constantly looking 
> up things I've forgotten. Thankfully, all that information is stored in my 
> ["outboard brain"](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-10/st_thompson) searchable by Google. I figured I'd collect the useful bits
> into a growing list, in the hope that others may benefit from my documented
> forgetfulness.
>
> It's really a letter of advice from Past Christina to Future Christina.

This document, of course, is a version for Future Kenny. Thanks Past and Present Christina!
